    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This project involved building the client-side for the MyFlix movie application using Angular. This single-page,
      responsive app interacts with the existing server-side code (REST API and database) from the MyFlix API project. The
      primary focus was on creating a feature-rich Angular application with supporting documentation for seamless
      collaboration among developers.</p>
    <h3>Purpose &amp; Context</h3>
    <p>Web developers often work in teams and need to have effective communication and collaboration skills. This project taught me to enhance my collaboration skills through documentation, feedback, and contributions to the tech community. By
      building the client-side for MyFlix using Angular I was able to learn how to demonstrate my proficiency in large-scale
      projects and complex user interfaces. The project aligned with Agile project management techniques, emphasizing
      user stories, story points, and kanban boards.</p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective was to create a single-page, responsive movie app using Angular, supporting existing server-side
      code from the MyFlix API project. The app facilitates user requests and renders server-side responses through various interface views. The
      project also includes comprehensive documentation, including a kanban board, technical documentation, and
      handoff deliverables, showcasing my Angular skills and my ability to communicate effectively with fellow developers.
    </p>
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>The development approach involves Agile project management techniques, with a focus on user stories, story
      points, and a kanban board. The step-by-step process includes setting up project management tools, creating an
      Angular app, implementing user registration and login forms, designing using Angular Material, defining routing,
      and commenting on the codebase. The approach also includes thorough documentation and handoff preparation.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>Integrating Angular Material for designing user registration and login forms.
      Creating a responsive and visually appealing movie card component.
      Defining routing for seamless navigation between different views.
      Ensuring accurate documentation, including comments and technical documentation using Typedoc and JSDoc.</p>
    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
