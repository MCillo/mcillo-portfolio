    <h1 class="title">MyFlix Angular Client Case Study</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The project involves building the client-side for the myFlix movie application using Angular. This single-page,
      responsive app will interact with an existing server-side code (REST API and database) from Achievement 2. The
      primary focus is on creating a feature-rich Angular application with supporting documentation for seamless
      collaboration among developers.</p>
    <h3>Purpose &amp; Context</h3>
    <p>As remote work gains prominence, effective communication and collaboration are crucial skills. This Achievement
      aims to enhance collaboration skills through documentation, feedback, and contributions to the tech community. By
      building the client-side for myFlix using Angular, developers can demonstrate their proficiency in large-scale
      projects and complex user interfaces. The project aligns with Agile project management techniques, emphasizing
      user stories, story points, and kanban boards.</p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective is to create a single-page, responsive movie app using Angular, supporting existing server-side
      code. The app will facilitate user requests and render server-side responses through various interface views. The
      project will also include comprehensive documentation, including a kanban board, technical documentation, and
      handoff deliverables, showcasing Angular skills and the ability to communicate effectively with fellow developers.
    </p>
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>The development approach involves Agile project management techniques, with a focus on user stories, story
      points, and a kanban board. The step-by-step process includes setting up project management tools, creating an
      Angular app, implementing user registration and login forms, designing using Angular Material, defining routing,
      and commenting on the codebase. The approach also includes thorough documentation and handoff preparation.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>Integrating Angular Material for designing user registration and login forms.
      Creating a responsive and visually appealing movie card component.
      Defining routing for seamless navigation between different views.
      Ensuring accurate documentation, including comments and technical documentation using Typedoc and JSDoc.</p>
    <h3>Duration</h3>
    <p>The project duration spans multiple exercises, each contributing to different aspects of the Angular app
      development. The timeline may vary based on individual progress and engagement with the learning materials.</p>
    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p>This project is part of an educational experience, guided by provided resources. The fictional movie app serves
      as a practical demonstration of Angular skills, project management using Agile techniques, and effective
      documentation practices. The collaboration with peers, providing constructive feedback, and contributing to the
      tech community showcase the developer's ability to work in a team and communicate technical concepts. The final
      project will be added to the developer's portfolio, demonstrating proficiency in Angular development and
      collaborative skills.</p>
