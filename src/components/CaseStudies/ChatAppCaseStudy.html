    <h1 class="title">Chat App Case Study</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In this project I aimed to develop a mobile chat application using React Native, Expo, and Google Firestore
      Database.
      The app offers a seamless chat experience, including features such as sending messages, images, and location
      data. This native application caters to both Android and iOS users, emphasizing a visually appealing and
      accessible design.</p>
    <h3>Purpose &amp; Context</h3>
    <p>As our mobile usage continues to rise, native mobile applications have become essential for everyday tasks,
      including
      communication. This project addresses the evolving landscape of mobile app development by leveraging React Native,
      Expo, and Google Firestore Database. While building this feature-rich chat app, I was able to learn essential
      skills in
      JavaScript mobile development to gain experience in the ever-growing mobile app industry.</p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>My primary objective was to create a robust React Native chat app that supports real-time communication, image
      sharing, location sharing, and offline message access. The app was styled according to design specifications that
      offers its users the ability to customize their chat experience. Authentication is handled through Google
      Firebase, and data storage utilizes both Firestore and local storage for offline access.</p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>The development approach involved a step-by-step process that started with setting up the development environment
      and creating the app's layout based on provided screen designs. The Gifted Chat library was then employed to
      implement the app's interface and functionality. Authentication, real-time data storage, offline functionality, and
      communication features were then progressively integrated using Google Firebase and local storage.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>This was the first project that I did that focused solely on mobile development. Implementing real-time communication features such as image sharing and location sharing.
      Ensuring seamless offline functionality, allowing users to access locally stored messages.
      Adhering to design specifications and accessibility considerations for a diverse user base.
      Integrating Firebase authentication and Firestore database seamlessly into the app.</p>
    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <p>React Native, Expo, Google Firestore Database</p>
