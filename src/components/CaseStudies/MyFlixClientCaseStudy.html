    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This project is the second part of the MyFlix Web Application. It is the client-side development of the myFlix
      web application aims to create a responsive and dynamic user interface
      using React. This component complements the server-side code by facilitating user interactions,
      rendering responses from the server-side, and providing a polished user experience. The client-side, developed
      using full-stack JavaScript technologies within the MERN stack, will enable movie enthusiasts to access and manage
      information about different movies.</p>
    <h3>Purpose &amp; Context</h3>
    <p>Client-side development has become a crucial aspect of modern web applications, with libraries like React
      enhancing user experiences. In this Achievement, the goal is to build a client-side interface for the myFlix app,
      which seamlessly integrates with the previously developed server-side (Achievement 2). Full-stack developers must
      excel in both server-side and client-side development to deliver comprehensive and user-friendly applications.</p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Utilizing React, the objective is to build the client-side of the myFlix app based on the existing server-side
      code, including the REST API and database. The client-side will feature a single-page, responsive app with
      routing, rich interactions, and various interface views. This achievement contributes to showcasing mastery in
      full-stack JavaScript development, emphasizing the importance of well-organized and maintainable code.</p>
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>The development process will involve creating React components for different views, handling data through the
      REST API endpoints defined in the server-side, and ensuring a smooth user experience. Attention will be given to
      code readability, maintenance, and the design and usability of the myFlix app. Key features such as movie listing,
      filtering, detailed views, user authentication, and profile management will be implemented to meet user
      requirements.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>Ensuring seamless integration with the existing server-side code.
      Implementing state routing for a single-page application (SPA).
      Managing state efficiently, especially for features like movie filtering.
      Incorporating Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness while maintaining a cohesive design.
      Balancing the complexity of optional features to enhance user experience.</p>
