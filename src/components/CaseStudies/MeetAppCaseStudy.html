    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project is to develop a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) using React, following a
      test-driven development (TDD) approach. The application will utilize the Google Calendar API to fetch and display
      upcoming events. The integration of serverless architecture and PWA features ensures a scalable, cost-effective,
      and user-friendly web app with offline capabilities.</p>
    <h3>Purpose &amp; Context</h3>
    <p>Serverless architecture and PWAs represent the forefront of web development, offering benefits such as ease of
      scalability, cost efficiency, offline support, and enhanced user experience. This project combines these concepts,
      employing a TDD technique to prioritize code quality and test coverage. The application will not only serve as a
      practical tool for viewing events but also showcase advanced web development skills, including serverless
      functions, PWA features, and data visualization.</p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The primary objective is to build a React-based PWA that leverages serverless functions, specifically AWS Lambda,
      for the authorization server. Employing the TDD technique, the app will allow users to filter events by city,
      show/hide event details, specify the number of events, and use the app offline. Additionally, the app will
      implement charts for data visualization, enhancing its visual appeal and analytical capabilities.</p>
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>The development approach involves a TDD cycle, where tests are written before the actual functionality. The
      Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication flow will be integrated, and serverless functions (preferably AWS
      Lambda) will serve as the backend. PWA features, including offline support and the ability to add an app shortcut
      to the home screen, will be implemented. Data visualization using charts (scatterplot and pie chart) will be added
      to enhance the app's visual appeal.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>Integrating serverless functions and ensuring their seamless interaction with the Google Calendar API.
      Implementing a responsive design that works well across various screen sizes, including mobile and tablet.
      Achieving and maintaining a test coverage rate of >= 90% throughout the development process.
      Meeting the technical requirements for PWA and serverless architecture, including offline support and cloud
      deployment.</p>
    <h3>Duration</h3>
    <p>The project timeline will be determined by the TDD cycles, with each phase focusing on a specific feature or
      requirement. The duration may vary based on individual progress and familiarity with the technologies.</p>
    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p>This project is part of a continuous learning experience, guided by educational resources. The fictional Meet app
      serves as a practical demonstration of skills in serverless architecture, PWA development, and test-driven
      development using React. The technical requirements, including the use of AWS Lambda, Google Calendar API, and
      advanced data visualization, showcase the developer's proficiency in cutting-edge web technologies. The resulting
      web app will be hosted on GitHub Pages, providing a shareable and installable platform.</p>
